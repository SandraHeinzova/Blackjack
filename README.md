Here are simple rules:
  1) The objective of the game is to beat the computer/dealer by having a hand value higher than the dealer's without exceeding 21.
  2) Each card has a point value. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens and Jacks) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value would be more beneficial to the player's hand.
